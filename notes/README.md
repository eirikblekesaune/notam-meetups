# Notam SuperCollider Meetup notes
In this folder we will put summaries from the meetups.
The summaries will consist of links and comments from the meetup participants.
This will be based on the meetup chat log.

If you want to substitute your name for your GitHub username, or you want your name to be removed, please submit a PR.

The overall idea is to try to get an overview og the topics we explore during these meetups.
We will try to organise these insights, tips, tricks and materials in the relevant folders in the root of this repo.
