# Rhythms

For the spring season 2023 we will, in the beginning at least, focus mainly on rhythmic strutures.

In this fold we will gather suggestions and concretions for ideas and material where SuperCollider is used to compose rhythms in various ways.

Feel free to send pull request or make issues for this repo.
